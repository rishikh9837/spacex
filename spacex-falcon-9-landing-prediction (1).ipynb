It is designed to transport payloads, such as satellites or spacecraft, into space.\n","SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.\n","\n","In the context of predicting the success of the Falcon 9 first stage landing, the concept of **classification** plays a crucial role. Classification is a fundamental task in **machine learning** that involves categorizing or assigning an input to one of several predefined classes or categories. In this case, we can frame the problem as a binary classification task, where **we aim to determine whether the first stage landing will be successful or not**.\n","\n","To perform classification, we typically rely on historical data that includes both input features and their corresponding labels. In this scenario, we would gather data from previous Falcon 9 launches and their outcomes, including whether the first stage successfully landed or not. The input features could include various parameters and measurements related to the rocket's performance, trajectory, and environmental conditions during the launch.\n","\n","Using this historical data, we can train a classification model, such as a decision tree, logistic regression, or a more advanced algorithm like a neural network, to learn patterns and relationships between the input features and the corresponding landing outcomes. The model will then generalize from the training data to make predictions on new, unseen instances.\n","\n","Once the classification model is trained and validated, it can be used to **predict the success of future Falcon 9 first stage landings**. By inputting relevant data from a new launch, such as real-time telemetry or pre-launch parameters, the model can classify whether the landing is likely to be successful or not. This prediction can then be used to estimate the cost of the launch, as SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage significantly affects the pricing."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# 1.
